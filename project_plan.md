# 🚀 InvoiceGen Pro: Architecture & Roadmap

## 🧐 Current Status Review
**Phases 1-5 Complete.**
The application is a fully functional, AI-powered, API-connected document generator.

**Core Strengths:**
*   **Dual Engine:** Seamlessly handles structured Invoices and complex Lease Agreements.
*   **Connected:** Fetches real-time reservation data from Ownima.
*   **Mobile-First:** "Wizard Mode" makes complex data entry easy on phones.
*   **Visuals:** High-fidelity PDF generation with auto-highlighting of critical data (Early/Late times).

## 🔮 The Future: "Pro" Features Roadmap

### 🚧 Phase 6: Digital Signatures (The "Paperless" Step)
**Goal:** Allow users (Renters/Owners) to sign directly on the device screen.
*   **Signature Pad:** Integrate `react-signature-canvas` into the `WizardContainer` (Step 5).
*   **State Management:** Store signatures as Base64 data URIs in `LeaseData`.
*   **PDF Integration:** Render the captured signature image into the PDF signature block, replacing the text placeholder.
*   **Value:** True "Walk-in" experience—generate, sign, and email PDF without a printer.

### 📅 Phase 7: Local Document History (The "Dashboard" Step)
**Goal:** Persist generated documents so users don't lose work when starting new ones.
*   **Storage Engine:** Implement `idb` (IndexedDB wrapper) to bypass `localStorage` size limits.
*   **Dashboard UI:** Create a "History" sidebar tab listing past Invoices/Leases.
*   **Actions:** Add "Clone", "Delete", and "Reprint" capabilities.
*   **Search:** Filter history by Name, Date, or ID.

### ⚡ Phase 8: PWA & Offline Capability (The "Field" Step)
**Goal:** Make the app installable and functional without internet (except API fetching).
*   **Manifest:** Add `manifest.json` for "Add to Home Screen".
*   **Service Worker:** Cache app shell (JS/CSS) for instant loading.
*   **Offline Mode:** Graceful handling of API errors when offline (allow manual entry fallback).

## 💡 Backlog & Experiments

### 1. 🧠 AI "God Mode"
*   **Idea:** A single text area entry point. The AI analyzes the text and auto-routes to `InvoiceForm` or `LeaseForm` with pre-filled data.

### 2. 📤 One-Click Share
*   **Idea:** Instead of just downloading, use the Web Share API to send the PDF directly to WhatsApp/Telegram/Email on mobile devices.

### 3. 🎨 Theme Engine
*   **Idea:** Allow users to upload a logo and select a primary color (Brand Identity) that propagates to the PDF styles.
